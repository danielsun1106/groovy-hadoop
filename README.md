# Groovy Hadoop 

This project's intention is to bring the power and expressiveness of [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) 
to the almighty [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) framework to support *ad-hoc* Hadoop job execution right 
from the command line with expressive Java or Groovy syntax and without the need to create Java projects and 
executable JAR files.  

The [project's documentation site](http://tthevis.github.com/groovy-hadoop/) features additional
information as well as a tutorial and a complete command line interface specification.
